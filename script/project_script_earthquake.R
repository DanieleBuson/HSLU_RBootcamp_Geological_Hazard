# As we can see from the graph the month with the highest frequency is October.
# However, we cannot say anything more about the data. The minimum frequency is
# registered in the month of December. This is due to the fact that the last
# record date is 12th of December. That means that the month was not complete.
# That explain the low number compared to the other months. We have a similar
# situation with March, since the first day on the record is the 3rd (just 2 days
# missing).
# Our analysis is that the month have no influence on the frequency of earthquakes.
# We want now to analyse if the month has some influence on the magnitude of
# an earthquake.

# The summary result shows that the ANOVA model is significant for a test at 
# significance level alpha = 0.05. In fact the p-value of the test is 0.0192 and 
# the F-statistic is big enough. However, we believe that this statistic is
# due to random circumstances. In fact, changing an arbitrary parameter as the 
# significance level alpha to a lower value (for example 0.01) could be enough 
# to completely change our point of view. We therefore decide not to consider

# Moreover, we want to specify an aspect related to magnitude that will appear
# frequently in our data. The magnitude of an earthquake could be negative. 
# This records are part of the phenomenon of micro-seismicity.This kind of 
# earthquakes are not felt by humans but the devices can detected them. Since their
# intensity (logarithmic) is lower than the 0 in the Richter scale,
