# HSLU_RBootcamp_Geological_Hazard

## Overview

Welcome to the "HSLU_RBootcamp_Geological_Hazard" project. This study focuses on the analysis of geological hazards arising from earthquakes and volcano eruptions. We explore and analyze geological data to better understand the potential risks and impacts of these natural phenomena.

## Project Background

This project was undertaken as part of the "R-Bootcamp" module at HSLU (University of Applied Sciences of Luzern). It serves as our initial venture into the world of data analysis and research, and it represents our efforts to apply R programming skills to a real-world scenario.

## Authors

The authors of this project are:
- **Daniele Buson**
- **Morteza Haftlang Kiani**

## Project Scope

### Data Analysis

In this project, we delve into the realms of geological data analysis. We aim to uncover valuable insights and patterns in geological hazard data, specifically focusing on earthquakes and volcano eruptions. Our analysis is conducted entirely in the R programming language.

### Original Version

It's important to note that this project represents our initial foray into data analysis with R. We have preserved the original version to showcase our learning journey and progress. While it may not be a flawless representation of our capabilities, we encourage users and readers to provide feedback and inform us of any issues or improvements that can be made. Your insights will greatly contribute to our growth as data analysts.

### Future Developments

We are committed to refining our skills and improving this project over time. As we gain more experience and knowledge, we plan to revisit and enhance the analysis, code, and documentation. Your feedback will be invaluable in this process.

## Feedback

If you come across any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or wish to collaborate on this project, please don't hesitate to contact us. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated.

Thank you for your interest in our "HSLU_RBootcamp_Geological_Hazard" project. We look forward to your valuable input and hope that our study contributes to a better understanding of geological hazards.
